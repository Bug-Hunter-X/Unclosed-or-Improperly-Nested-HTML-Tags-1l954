# Unclosed or Improperly Nested HTML Tags
This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: unclosed or improperly nested tags.  Unclosed tags can cause rendering issues, while improper nesting leads to unexpected layout and semantic problems. The `bug.html` file showcases the error, and `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected code.

This simple example highlights the importance of carefully writing and validating HTML code to ensure consistent and correct rendering in web browsers.
