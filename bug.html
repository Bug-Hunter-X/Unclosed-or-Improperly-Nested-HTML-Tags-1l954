<p>This is a common error when working with HTML, but often overlooked. The issue arises from using a tag that's not correctly closed or nested in the wrong place. For example, consider this code snippet:</p><code><div><p>This is a paragraph.</p>  </div></code><p>Here, the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag is not closed correctly. The correct code should be:</p><code><div><p>This is a paragraph.</p></div></code><p>Another common error is improper nesting of elements. You can't have a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag inside a <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag, which is a list item. This might produce unexpected rendering in the browser. Incorrect nesting can cause issues with layout and semantics.</p>
